# Quick note: Mano, do you understand how naming conventions work? 
# For exemple: variable naming convention for javascript is camel case 
# such as " var myCar". But in python is "my_car", which is called sanake case.
# Files also have naming convention. For instance, when you have a file with a class Car
# you name the file of Car.py, but you have a file with a function, say "def get_car():"
# you name it car.py  

# Mano, my clients has a proble: he goes shopping his groceries every other day and he
# hates the fact that he has to work out the expenses and how much money he has to give
# to the counter in his head. So, he's looking for a simple calculator that helps him
# with the boring repetitive process. Could you build a simple calculator, easy to use? 

#### The calculater shoud have addiction, multplication, subtraction and division functions
### so that when the clients needs the total of his workouts, he only needs to do the following

# for example: total = add function + subtruction function
### Also, have in mind that the client should have a clear message on what operation he's doing. 

## hint: use of functions, loops and conditionals
